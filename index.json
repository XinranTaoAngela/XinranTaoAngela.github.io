I conducted market research and identified growth opportunities for increasing user volume. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and implement targeted marketing campaigns, including opening up the new Saudi Arabia user group. During my short time at Partybus, our team Successfully increased user volume by 30% through the implementation of targeted marketing campaigns and mainly focuing on the Middle East user experience.\nExperience at Three During my tenure as a Marketing and Product Management Intern, I embarked on a collaborative endeavor with the adept software development team at Holla, seamlessly integrating the highly anticipated \u0026ldquo;Space\u0026rdquo; features into the newly developped app Three. By meticulously orchestrating the implementation process and fostering effective communication channels, I harmonized these features with the overarching objectives, ensuring an as seamless as possible user experience. Additionally, I managed version control for the app\u0026rsquo;s root files, tracking changes and updates to maintain codebase integrity and facilitate smooth rollout of enhancements.\nTo deliver better experiences and optimize user engagement, I extracted data from Reddit, and developed a predictive model to discern potential user profiles, enabling recommendations for targeted marketing strategies and product enhancements. Furthermore, by architecting and implementing an SQL database, integrating Zendesk data, and employing data analysis techniques, I gained insights into user interactions, support tickets, and feedback.\n","permalink":"http://XinranTaoAngela.github.io/experience/holla_intern/","summary":"Duration Start time: June 2021 End time: April 2023\nProjects Followed: PartyBus \u0026amp; Three: \u0026ldquo;Derivatives\u0026rdquo; of Monkey Experience at PartyBus My primary focus was on optimizing user volume and analyzing marketing strategies.

However, it has been difficult for students to assess the quality and difficulty of a course. Students generally seek such information through ratemyprofessor.com (RMP) and course evaluations (CE) published on Albert.\nIssues with the sources RMP mainly provides ratings for professors but not for classes themselves. Second, it is highly biased. Most of the ratings and comments that professors receive on the website come from students with strong opinions, thus the ratings are highly skewed. Third, the sample size of the ratings are usually very small, which makes the ratings inaccurate. Albert’s course evaluations are available for students and can offer a more objective evaluation of a course, but it is very inconvenient to view them. Furthermore, although students can see the ratings on different attributes of a given course, they cannot see courses that match their expectation for quality and/or difficulty. In other words, Albert CE only takes a course as an input and outputs many attributes but not vice versa. Furthermore, because there are so many attributes, it is difficult to compare courses. Our product addresses these problems.\nour solution Through machine learning methods, we create and present to the users new concise metrics that summarize the quality and difficulty of all courses using CE data. In addition, it is a two-way interaction, meaning that users can define a quality and/or difficulty and then we output matching classes, or they can define a class and we then output their quality and difficulty.\nData Using selenium, we scraped Alber’s course evaluations for Stern and CAS. Our dataset includes information on 1703 Stern courses and 9667 CAS courses. There are 7 CE ratings for each Stern course, and 17 for CAS. For both schools, we have course code, course name, instructor, response rates for all courses. Furthermore, we scraped all NYU professor ratings and student\nAnalysis Our initial explorations included looking at the distribution of ratings across CE and RMP, comparing sample sizes, and examining the correlation matrix. A very important finding is that on average, professor quality rating on RMP is about 15% lower than that on CE, and with a much larger variation. The average sample size for each rating on CE is almost 3 times of that on RMP (39.37 vs. 13.67).\nFeatures Most of the features are highly correlated with each other, but “Challenging” correlates much less with all other features. This hints the fact that there will be two prominent principal components. In fact there is. From principal component analysis, we found that the first 2 PCs explained about 82% of the variance in the data, which means 2 questions are all it needs on the course evaluations. From analyzing the loadings plots, we characterized the first 2 PCs as Quality and Difficulty, respectively. This PCA analysis serves as the backbone for our project.\nAPP frontend front page We created 3 functional pages. At the left side of the front page, we have the menu button which allows users to navigate through four possible pages that can satisfies different needs while searching for classes. CAS \u0026amp; Stern course summary: This page presents the distribution of the overall rating for both stern and cas classes. We show the graphs of distribution of the overall rating for both stern and cas classes. This page is for the basic understanding of the users, but not considering any actual functionality.\nCAS course search page This page enables users to search courses in NYU CAS. The frontend features including streamlit’s checkboxes, sliders, and text boxes. These features are to help users to select and deselect some features of the course, and also allows them to freely navigate the characteristics based on their personal preferences of courses. For cas courses, users can search department courses by difficulty, quality, or both. The two metrics are presented in a scale of 5 based on percentile. For example, difficulty of 1 represents courses in the 0-20th percentile in terms of difficulty, which are the relatively easiest courses within the department. Whereas quality of 5 represents the courses with the highest quality. Users can choose whether to display course evaluation ratings, if not, only the course information and name of professor will be displayed. Users can also choose to look for courses by course code or professor’s name to look at the course evaluations and their corresponding difficulty and quality in comparison to other courses.\nStern course search page Stern course evaluations have different questions than CAS courses, and there is no difficulty rating for Stern courses. Therefore, there will only be quality rating for course searches, with all else being the same as the CAS page.\n","permalink":"http://XinranTaoAngela.github.io/projects/courseeval/","summary":"Duration September 2022- December 2022\nGithub https://github.com/XinranTaoAngela/CourseEval\nProject Goal Course selection and scheduling have always been the top priority for students before semesters start.
